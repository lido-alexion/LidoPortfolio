# LidoPortfolio / StoX V8 Wishlist

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Document type** | Canonical V8 planning register |
| **Created** | 2026-09-09 |
| **Status** | EARLY PLANNING |
| **Canonical path** | `specs/LidoPortfolio-V8-Wishlist.md` |
| **Predecessor** | `specs/LidoPortfolio-V7-Wishlist.md` |

## 1. Purpose

V8 contains the **Standalone Telemetry Platform** and deferred follow-on data-bootstrap work that is intentionally kept outside the V7 closure gate.

The Telemetry Platform is separated from StoX product implementation because it is a separate, independently deployable, product-independent application. StoX is its first intended client, but building the Telemetry product and integrating StoX with it are separate roadmap concerns.

V8 also contains the one-time Historical Fundamental Data Bootstrap, deferred from V7 until the historical dataset/source is prepared and selected.

## 2. Current V8 backlog

| ID | Feature | Scope / rationale | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| V4-FEAT-052 | Standalone Telemetry Platform | Build the product-independent telemetry/analytics platform as a separate repository/application. Core architecture is already decided in `specs/V7-Telemetry-Platform.md`; the historical filename is retained for now, but this V8 register supersedes its earlier V7 roadmap placement. | CORE ARCHITECTURE DECIDED |
| V4-FEAT-054 | Historical Fundamental Data Bootstrap | One-time population of StoX with available historical quarterly and annual fundamental data after the V7 canonical fundamental model exists. The import may use custom/offline scripts rather than the FEAT-053 live fetcher. StoX imposes no fixed historical-depth window; the canonical store and downstream analytics must support whatever depth is imported. Detailed source, extraction method, mapping and bootstrap procedure remain OPEN until the historical dataset is prepared/selected. | OPEN / DEFERRED |

## 3. Boundary

V8 owns the Telemetry product itself: ingestion, storage, analytics/query APIs, dashboards/explorer, SDKs, identity/correlation model, events/metrics/logs/traces, retention, export, deletion, administration and the other capabilities frozen in the Telemetry architecture specification.

V8 also owns the one-time historical fundamental bootstrap outcome, but does not change FEAT-053's ongoing provider-driven fundamental ingestion architecture.

V8 does **not** own StoX-specific Telemetry instrumentation/integration. That is planned as a separate V9 StoX epic.
